          When you purchase products, only the seller of those products will see
          your name and the items you purchased from them. No other users will
          see your orders. Sellers only see the buyer nameâ€”not the email or any
          other private data.

          Once an order is created, it cannot be updated or deleted by you or
          any other user. Even if a product related to the order is deleted by
          its creator, a clone of that product will be stored with the order to
          maintain consistency. However, the creator of the product will be
          anonymized. Orders are only permanently deleted when the associated
          user deletes their account.

          When you become an ADMIN, your products will be visible on the

          users will be able to view other products by you from the product
          page.
